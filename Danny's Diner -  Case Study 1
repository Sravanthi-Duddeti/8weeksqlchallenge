# Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner ::ramen::

![Danny's Diner](https://datawithdanny.com/img/case-study-1.jpg)

Danny’s Diner is a small Japanese restaurant that opened in early 2021, offering three of Danny’s favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.
To better understand his customers and improve the business, Danny needs help analyzing the data collected during the restaurant’s initial months of operation. 
With this data, Danny hopes to answer key questions about customer behavior, spending patterns, and menu preferences. 
These insights will guide decisions on whether to expand the customer loyalty program and how to provide a more personalized experience for loyal customers.

## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers:

**Customer Spending Patterns**: How much money each customer spends and how frequently they visit.
**Menu Preferences**: Which menu items are most popular among customers.
**Loyalty Program Impact**: How the restaurant's loyalty program affects customer behavior, particularly which items customers buy after joining and which items they bought before becoming members.

The data will help Danny make informed decisions regarding:
1. Personalizing the customer experience.
2. Expanding the loyalty program.
3. Generating datasets for easy inspection by the restaurant team.

## Objectives

The case study will use SQL to answer the following key questions:

1. **Total Amount Spent**: Calculate the total amount spent by each customer.
2. **Visitation Frequency**: Identify how many distinct days each customer has visited the restaurant.
3. **First Purchase**: Determine the first menu item purchased by each customer.
4. **Most Purchased Item**: Find the most popular item purchased by customers.
5. **Customer-Specific Popularity**: Identify the most purchased item for each customer.
6. **Pre-Membership and Post-Membership Behavior**: Analyze customer behavior before and after joining the loyalty program.
7. **Points Calculation**: Calculate loyalty points based on purchases, with special multipliers for certain items.

Additionally, we will generate summarized datasets for easy inspection.

## Available Data

Danny has shared 3 key datasets for this case study:

- **sales**: Captures customer purchases with corresponding `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `product_id`.
- **menu**: Contains product information like `product_id`, `product_name`, and `price`.
- **members**: Captures customer `join_date` for the loyalty program.
